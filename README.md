# LOGIC SIMULATOR
a logic gates circuit simulator
#What is it ?

logic simulator is a file based simulator which work on a file that describe the logic gates circuit you have 
and it is fully designed according to the OOP design concepts

# Instalation
## Visual Studio

just build it inside the ide and you will have a directory called debug inside the project file.inside it you will find the application

# Writing the simulation file

like in the repository file "circuit.txt", first you should copy it in the folder where your built application is located

you write your circuit description from the left to the right and this is a must do thing !
then you set the input nodes of your circuit
then you write X at the end of the circuit telling the simulator to calculate things
then you start chosing which nodes you want to see and if you want to see all the nodes you just type "output all"

# running the application
open your command prompt then access the folder containing the built application file and then type 
logicsimulator.exe then your circuit file name " note that the file has to be in the same folder with the application
